# Face-Detection_using_Colab

The motive of this file is to help others(people with no coding experience ) to have a look and make it easy looking 
This code is made using 3 simple libraries:
1. CV2
2. matplotlib
3. NumPY

"Here's a simple project that can be created in Google Colab. Even someone with no coding experience can work on it.

The file "project_2_facedetection.ipynb" is a complete Chrome file. You can download it and upload it to Colab, and it's ready to go."

here are some screenshots of the code

1. The imported libs

3. The conversion of the image from BGR to Gray format

4. Assigning the models

5. Assigning the condition for the face recognition

6. The final code for presenting the image

7. The final result will be like

To ensure accuracy, we must utilize Jupyter Lab. Start by installing Anaconda Navigator, then run JupyterLab, upload the file, and you're ready to roll.

1. There is a slight difference in the lib

2. Be careful in setting the image path and go through the image for a guide

3. The same process of converting the image to gray

6. Implementing the model

8. Well this model has a good accuracy as you can see it below

This is a simple Code even a person with no coding background can try out..
